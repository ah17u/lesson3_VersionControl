            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For my first topic I chose to talk about version control system and what that exactly is. To summarize what a version control system is, it is essentially a system that stores your projects/files and saves over periods of time, which allows you to view previous versions of those files. This topic interests me because it is a new topic I have learned and it seems like an extremely convenient way to develop projects. This is relevant to our course cause it not only helps the developer, but it can be useful for collaborations or group projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">For the second topic, I will discuss the advantages of using a version control system. For developers, using a version control system can be extremely beneficial. Developers can keep track of the various versions, which can even help them identify any problems they run into along the way. It is a great tool for collaboration in the sense that you can share and keep track of projects so easily. This topic interest me because it showed me that there is an easy way to keep track of your projects safely and not everything you code has to be set in stone. This is relevant for our class because it shows us a tool we can use for our assignments and even in the future of our coding.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The third topic is all about the system that is Git. Git is the most popular version control system used today and while I have heard about it, this lesson really explained to me what it does and how useful it can be. Github is a site that uses this system and with the system comes many commands. I found this topic interesting because it is the whole system that makes everything work, it also was something I enjoyed learning about as I had not gone too deep into reading about Git. This is extremely relevant for our class and relevant especially for this lesson as we learn how to use this system.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The fourth topic I will discuss is a quick summary of some of the basic Git commands that were explored this lesson. Along with Git comes some basic commands that are extremely important for using Git. Some of the commands we learned this lesson were commands like commit, push, pull, and clone. Commit allows you to commit any files you are using with Git. Push allows you to send various changes to the repository. Pull will allow you to pull over changes to the working directory. These are just some of the basic commands we learned. These commands are very relevant to the class because we need to know these to use Git, I found it very interesting to learn some new basic commands to help me use this.</p>
